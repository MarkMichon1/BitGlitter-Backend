# BitGlitter-Backend

This is the backend for the [BitGlitter desktop app](https://github.com/MarkMichon1/BitGlitter).  Its the 
[original Python library](https://github.com/MarkMichon1/BitGlitter-Python) wrapped in `Flask` and `SocketIO` for
bidirectional communication between it and ExpressJS integrated in the app.

The original Python library is included inside of this repository (rather than a dependency) because several important changes are made to it in order for the library to play nice inside of a desktop application.

More will be added as this nears completion. üëç
